TopHub
A small project that lists top GitHub repositories and their top contributors

Stack
The project is a small Sinatra app (with Sprockets for SCSS) using React as the rendering eingine

Note
You will need to run `bower install` to download necessary libraries, as I didn't include them in the repository
